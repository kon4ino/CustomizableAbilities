# CustomizableNailDamage

A mod that allows you to freely change the damage of the nail. You can make it negative, which will heal bosses, or turn the damage to, for example, 100, and see how much damage you deal.

You can also make the nail damage a non-integer number (0.1-0.9).

In the mod menu, you can change the mode of the mod (fractional and normal nail mode). 
When you press the 'U' key (by default), your nail damage will be increased by 1, when you press the 'I' key, it will be decreased by 1.
You can turn on and off the display of nail damage by pressing the 'O' key (or in the menu).

Have a nice game.
