# CustomizableNailDamage — ino_ (kon4ino)

Mod that allows you to change the damage of the nail, including negative and fractional values, and also the amount of soul received from nail hits. Negative nail damage heals enemies.
**This mod provides the following features:**
----------

Conveniently change integer nail damage (including negative) using standard keybinds (U — +1 damage, I — -1 damage), or by entering a custom value in the menu.

Display real-time nail damage on screen (including modified values, e.g., from Fragile Strength).

Enable fractional nail damage (e.g., 0.5).

Customize the amount of SOUL gained from nail hits — separately for the main vessel and for reserve vessels.


**Additional settings include:**
----------

Toggle the mod on/off.

Enable or disable fractional nail mode.

Enable enemy healing beyond their max HP when using negative nail damage.

Change keybinds.

Reset all settings to default values.


This mod affects all systems that rely on nail damage.
